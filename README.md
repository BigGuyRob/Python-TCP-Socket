# Both team members collaborated, and resources referenced include: 
# - The Python Socket documentation found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html for socket, timeout, and getting hostname information.
# - The Python Socket documentation for slicing objects found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html
# - StackOverflow - specifically for figuring out how to throw a timeout exception.
# - The Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book, found at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

# The problems faced in the process of developing this code are referenced in the documentation above. It consisted
# of how to get the hostname, how to set a timeout exception if no connection is received, and slicing information.
# We spent around 2 hours to get a running program, and maybe an hour or so afterwards tweaking it to make sure it 
# was as cohesive as possible.
# 
# 4.
# Yes - when testing this, we found out that sockets do not really work over two different networks due to port forwarding.
# When on a work laptop and having the server run on an iLab machine, the client received an error stating that
# the server actively refused connection - could possibly be a firewall thing.
# In addition to this, learning about the slice() function is also interesting.
